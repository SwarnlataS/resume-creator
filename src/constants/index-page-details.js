    description: `<p>Resumizer is an online web app that enables people to write and edit their resumes with ease and at no cost. We don't all have the money needed to hire a company to create these documents for us. In this case, we can do it ourselves, we make the tools available that you need to complete this endeavor.</p>
                <p>Doing it ourselves can be better at times since no one know us like ourselves. People we hire tend to just want to get it done and may not take the time needed to get it done right. Our Beginnings</p>
                <p>Resumizer was launched as a free resume creator suite that includes a collection of online career tools that are continuously improved with new features. The idea for Resumizer came about as a result of an internet search. The search results revealed resume resources that had several undesirable aspects; A cost or some sort of "catch", to create and/or download the resume. An inconvenience of having to join or sign up for a resume service before you know if you like it. Or the bother of having to sign up at all. Maybe I just want to make a resume and not have to go through all of that. Developing a free resume creator is an excellent way to help those who need a resume, but don't know how to write one. People aren't interested in signing up for yet another website. We wanted to create a resume service that didn't require users to have a membership.</p>
                <p>The service should also conform to the fact that, at that time, most things on the web were free. People want to make a resume and not have to pay for it. We knew we had a better way, so the concept for Resumizer was developed. A website that provides job seekers with services they need; free resumes at no cost!</p>`
